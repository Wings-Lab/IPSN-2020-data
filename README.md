Example of citing this paper:

\cite{ipsn20-localization} introduces a multiple transmitter localization method, namely MAP_{*}, that uses a hypotheses-based Bayesian approach in conjunction with a divide-and-conqure strategy to first localize "isolated" intruders and then localize the remaining intruders.

\cite{ipsn20-localization} also introduces a novel spectrum interpolation method, namely ILDW, which interpolates an unknown RSSI at a location using the surrounding known RSSI values in the logarithm distance domain.
