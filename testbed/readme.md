|10.6        | the raw data collected on Oct 6, 2019. Dimension is 100x18 (100 hypothesis, 18 sensors in a 10x10 grid)
|10.6.inter-ildw|Interpolate the raw data into 100x100 using ILDW |
|10.6.inter-ildw-sub|Sample a subset from 10.6.inter-ildw and get a dataset of 100x18, another set of 18 sensor different from the original deployed 18 sensors|

folder with idw is doing the interpolation with IDW instead of ILDW. 9.26 is just another testbed experiment on another date.
